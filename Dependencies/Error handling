The error:

```
'pnpm' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
```

means that **`pnpm`** is not installed on your system or is not added to your system‚Äôs **PATH**.

### ‚úÖ Here's how to fix it:

#### **Option 1: Install `pnpm` via `npm` (recommended)**

If you already have **Node.js** and **npm** installed:

1. Open **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell**.

2. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install -g pnpm
   ```

3. After installation, verify it:

   ```bash
   pnpm -v
   ```

#### **Option 2: Install `pnpm` via Corepack (Node 16.13+ only)**

If you're using **Node.js 16.13 or later**, `pnpm` can be enabled via Corepack:

1. Enable Corepack:

   ```bash
   corepack enable
   ```

2. Enable `pnpm`:

   ```bash
   corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate
   ```

3. Then check:

   ```bash
   pnpm -v
   ```

### üîÅ After installing:

Return to your project directory and run:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Let me know if you need help setting up Node.js or checking your environment variables.
